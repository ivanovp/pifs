\section{Introduction}
This file system was developed for embedded systems which use NOR flash as 
storage. 
The development started as teach-myself project and I released the code in 
hope that it will be useful for someone else as well. 

NOR flash ICs have very low price nowadays (2017) and can be used
to store files. But there are few problems to consider when designing a file
system:
\begin{itemize}
\item NOR flashes can be programmed (set bits to zero) by pages, but only 
can be erased (set bits to one) in a larger quantity, which are mostly called
block in the datasheets. One page is usually 256 or 512 bytes, one block 
consits of 16, 256, 1024, etc. pages. So typical block sizes are 4 KiB, 
64 KiB, 256 KiB.
\item Blocks can be erased ~10,000--100,000 times. After that data retention is 
not guaranteed. Therefore all blocks should be erased uniformly. This method 
is called wear leveling.
\end{itemize}

\pifs{} can be scaled from 4 Mbit (512 KiB), 256 Mbit (32 MiB), 
theoretically up to 1 Gbit (128 MiB) memory sizes.

The code is not MISRA compatible, but I've written MISRA code earlier and I 
tend to use the rules.
So I tried to use 'return' only at the end of functions, use 'break'
once in 'while' cycles or not use it at all and call one function from 
expressions (or not call functions at all from expressions). I didn't use
'goto' in the sources of file system, but you may find them in STM32 HAL's 
sources.

\subsection{Features of the \pifs{}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Small memory footprint
\item Files can be opened for update ("r+", "w+", "a+" modes are supported)
\item Size of logical page is user-defined
\item Cache buffer for page (currently only one page is cached)
\item Directory handling
\item Dynamic wear-leveling
\item Static wear-leveling (limited, work-in-progress)
\item User data can be added for files: permissions, owner IDs, etc.
\item At the beginning of flash memory reserved blocks can be defined, which 
are not used by the file system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations of the \pifs{}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only one flash chip can be used (one volume is supported)
\item Memory and file system configuration cannot be changed during run-time
\item One directory can only store pre-defined number of files or directories
\item No OS support yet, file system can be used only from one task
\item Incompatible with FAT file system, therefore cannot be used for USB mass
storage devices
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
\begin{labeling}{File system header} % <--- here goes the longest definition to measure the necessary space
\item[NOR flash] Special type of EEPROMs, which manufactured using NOR gates.

\item[Page] Array of several bytes in the flash memory. Number of bytes is 
power of two, usually 256 or 512 bytes. See \autoref{fig:flash}.

\item[Block] Composed of several pages. Usually a block contain 16, 256 or 1024
pages. See \autoref{fig:flash}.

\item[Logical page] Allocation unit of file system. User configurable option.
Larger logical page needs more RAM and less pages in management area.
Smaller logical page needs less RAM and more pages in management area.
It shall be larger or equal to page size. 
Define: \code{PIFS\_LOGICAL\_PAGE\_SIZE\_BYTE}

\item[Erase] Change data bits to one (logical high level). Only a whole block 
can be erased, which means all bits of the block are set to one.

\item[Program] Change data bits to zero (logical low level). Each bit of a page
can be programmed individually.

\item[Block address] Index of block in flash memory. 
Type: \code{pifs\_block\_address\_t}

\item[Page address] Index of a page in a block. It can be flash page address
for flash functions or logical page address for file system's functions.
Type: \code{pifs\_page\_address\_t}

\item[Page offset] Index of a byte in a page. It can be flash page offset
for flash functions or logical page offset for file system's functions.
Type: \code{pifs\_page\_offset\_t}

\item[Data area] Blocks which hold the file's content. 
See \autoref{fig:flashfs}.

\item[Management area] Blocks which hold the file system's internal
data, how much space is allocated, where are the data pages of files, etc. There are two types of management area: primary (active) management area, secondary (next) management area.
See \autoref{fig:flashfs}.

\item[File system header] First page of active management area contains the
header of file system. It describes address of free space bitmap, entry list,
delta map, wear level list, etc.
Type: \code{pifs\_header\_t}, variable: \code{pifs.header}.

\item[FSBM] Free space bitmap. It stores information about all logical pages 
of flash memory:
1 bit stores whether page is free, 1 bit stores if page is to be released.

\item[Delta page] If content of a file is overwritten and original page
cannot be overwritten because bits should be changed from 0 to 1, delta pages 
are added. When the original page is read from a given address the content of
delta page is provided from a different address.

\item[Map page] Management page which is used to describe data pages of a file.

\item[Entry list] Technically a directory of file system. If directories are
disabled, only root entry list exist.

\item[Entry] One file or directory in the directory.

\item[TBR] To be released. A page which was used, but now it can erased then 
allocated. If all pages in a block marked TBR, the block can be erased.

\item[Merge] During merge management area is written, blocks are erased, delta pages are resolved and entry list is compacted. The data is copied from primary to secondary management area and the next secondary management area is selected.

\section{Demonstration}
In the 'demo' directory three applications can be found.
\begin{enumerate}
\item pc\_emu: PC application which uses NOR flash emulator. It can be compiled
with GNU make an GCC.
\item maple\_mini\_pifs: Demo running on Maple Mini board, MCU is 
STM32F103RCBT6. There is no NOR flash, UART and debugger on board. So 
prototype should be created.
\item nucleo-f413zh\_pifs: Demo running on Nucleo-F413ZH board, MCU is
STM32F413ZH. There is no NOR flash memory on the board, some prototype hardware 
should be created.
It has internal debugger and virtual serial port. 
It can be compiled with GNU make and GCC or with STM32 System Workbench.
\item stm32\_f4ve\_pifs: Demo running on STM32-F4VE board, MCU is STM32F407VE. 
There is Winbond W25Q16DV NOR flash soldered on the board, but it has not got 
UART. 
So external debugger and USB-serial converter is needed.
It can be compiled with GNU make and GCC or with STM32 System Workbench.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Using demo}
All applications based on a command interpreter which communicates over UART.
There are commands to list directory, create and dump files, run some tests.

The commands:

\begin{labeling}{append} % <--- here goes the longest definition to measure the necessary space
\item[ls] List directory. Switches: \code{-l} display file size, \code{-e} 
examine file (for debugging). \code{-e} switch displays address of first
map page of file or entry list of directory.
\item[l] List directory with switches: -l and -e (for debugging).
\item[rm] Remove file. Switch: -a remove all files in the directory.
\item[dumpf] Dump file in hexadecimal format.
\item[df] Alias to \code{dumpf}.
\item[cat] Read and print file to console.
\item[create] Create file. You can type file until 'q' is entered in the 
first character of a line.
\item[append] Append to file. You can type file until 'q' is entered in the 
first character of a line.
\item[cd] Change directory. Only available if directories are enabled.
\item[mkdir] Make directory. Only available if directories are enabled.
\item[rmdir] Remove an empty directory. Only available if directories are 
enabled.
\item[cwd] Get current working directory. Only available if directories are 
enabled.
\item[dump] Read and show a flash page in hexadecimal format. First parameter
is the address, second optional parameter in number of flash pages to display.
Note: this command works with flash page size other ones work with logical 
page size!
Example: \code{dump 0x10000 2}
\item[d] Alias to \code{dump}.
\item[map] Decode and display a map page.
\end{labeling}

Example use of commands on a flash M25P40, where logical and flash page size 
are the same (256 bytes):
